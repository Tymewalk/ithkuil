// 7.4.11 Modality Suffixes
// Many of these correspond to the  modality suffixes used in valence/modality adjuncts (see Chapter 6). The nine degrees associated with each suffix allow a speaker control over the extent to which the modality category should apply to the utterance. These suffix forms function, then, as an alternative to adjunct forms for greater nuance in the applicability of the modality category and to apply them to nouns.
